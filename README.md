Some of my Gimp Splashes Screen, I update every week.

I've made this using Gimp and Upscayl.

<summary><b>Disclaimer</b></summary>

## I use the Flatpak version of Gimp, because I can install every Plugins in one click, but you can use this on the Native Package

##### I use a Photoshop like layout on Gimp, because I was a Photoshop user.
